print("=== AUTO-SCALING IMAGE DISPLAY IMPLEMENTED ===")
print()
print("KEY FEATURES:")
print("1. Image automatically scales to fit available window space")
print("2. Maintains aspect ratio (no stretching)")
print("3. Centers image in available area")
print("4. No scroll bars needed")
print("5. Resizes dynamically when window is resized")
print()
print("HOW IT WORKS:")
print("- Calculates scale factor to fit image in widget")
print("- Scales pixmap smoothly with anti-aliasing")
print("- Centers scaled image in available space")
print("- Adjusts click coordinates for calibration")
print()
print("TEST INSTRUCTIONS:")
print("1. Import any image (1600x1200 or any size)")
print("2. Image should fit completely in window")
print("3. Try resizing window - image scales accordingly")
print("4. Calibration clicks work correctly on scaled image")
print()
print("BENEFITS:")
print("- Always see full image without scrolling")
print("- Responsive to window resizing")
print("- Maintains image quality")
print("- Accurate coordinate mapping")
